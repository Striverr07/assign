ans1:In “Product” entity, the “category_id” attribute is a link to both “Product_Category” and “Product_Category”. All products have their corresponding category in Product_Category, whose identification in the form of id is found in the product’s category_id. In other words, each product has one such kind of category that establishes a relationship of many to one where several products belong to a particular category.
ans2:Foreign Key Constraint: Implement a foreign key constraint on the “category_id” attribute in the “Product” table. This constraint ensures that the “category_id” must exist in the “product_category” table. If an invalid category ID is inserted, the database will reject the operation.
     :Validation Rules: When inserting or updating data, validate that the “category_id” provided corresponds to an existing category. we can do this programmatically in the application code or through database triggers.
     :Referential Integrity: Regularly check for referential integrity by verifying that all “category_id” values in the “Product” table match valid IDs in the “product_category” table.
